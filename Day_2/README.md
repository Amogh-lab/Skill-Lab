## 🎯 Activities Overview

### 1. 🔄 Rotating Moving Boxes (CSS Animation)
- Created two animated boxes using `@keyframes`.
- **Left box** moves from left to right, **right box** moves in the opposite direction.
- Each box rotates 360° while moving horizontally.
- Background uses a high-quality Unsplash image.
- Demonstrates usage of `translateX`, `rotate`, and infinite animations.
- Unused Emmet syntax `div*9>` was present, possibly left for further development.

### 2. 🗂️ RVCE Subjects Webpage (Flexbox Layout)
- Built a clean, professional layout to display RVCE subjects:
  - Top **navbar** with institution title.
  - Left **sidebar** listing subjects.
  - Right **main content** area describing each subject briefly.
- Implemented using **CSS Flexbox** for a responsive two-column layout.
- Theming aligns with RVCE branding using dark blue (`#002147`) and neutral grays.

### 3. 🧪 JavaScript DOM Interaction (Simple Script)
- Clicking the button triggers a paragraph content change.
- Highlighted the use of `onclick` and `getElementById`.
- Minor HTML error: button tag was left unclosed.

---

### 4. 🧱 3x3 Grid Layout (CSS Grid)
- Created a **3x3 responsive grid** with numbered boxes from 1 to 9.
- Grid uses:
  - `display: grid`
  - `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)`
  - `gap: 10px`
- Each box uses Flexbox for center alignment and has a consistent style (`#af4c4c` on light background).
